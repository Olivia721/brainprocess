# Brain connectivity
This repository contains processes for studying the brain connectivity on electroencephalography data (EEG) through
- Phase locking value (PLV)
- Weighted phase lag index (wPLI)
- Orhogonalized correlation coefficient (OCC)

It also includes some functions for evaluating statistical properties of such results.
